What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

What Worked Well:
- The JUnit framework provided an organized structure to test cases, and assertions made it easy to check expected versus actual results.
- Debugging became more structured since test failures pointed directly to logical inconsistencies in the implementation.

Challenges Faced:
- Understanding the correct way to structure assertions for more complex behaviors, like as ensuring a Passenger cannot board a full Car was confusing at first. 

Advice: 
- Write tests iterativelyâ€”starting with simple cases and then build up to more complex scenarios. This would have been a super useful approach when developing the Chatbot
- Use meaningful assertions and structure test cases logically to make debugging easier. When writing tests explore and consider the edge cases that may go unnoticed.
